					What is Interview?
				</header>
				<p>
					An interview is a formal conversation between two or more people,
                    typically with one person, the interviewer, asking questions to 
                    obtain information, assess qualifications, or evaluate the 
                    suitability of a candidate for a job, admission, or other purposes.

                    Interviews are commonly used in various contexts, including employment, 
                    academic admissions, journalism, and research, to gather insights, 
                    make informed decisions, or establish a connection between individuals.

					Introduction
				</header>
				<p>
					When creating a structured interview, 
                    you need to make sure you provide time 
                    at the beginning of the interview for 
                    introductions and initial conversations 
                    with a candidate. This helps the candidate 
                    become more comfortable before beginning 
                    the actual interview. Here are some good 
                    examples of introductory questions to ask:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How are you?</li>
					<li>Did you find us ok</li>
					<li>Can you tell me a bit about yourself</li>
                    <li>What hobbies do you enjoy outside of your job field</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section class="main-section" id="Description">
				<header>
					Review the job description
				</header>
				<p>
					Read through the job description and 
                    highlight the key skills and qualifications 
                    an eligible candidate should have. 
                    Also, look over the job duties or daily 
                    tasks for the role. Using this information, 
                    make one list of skills and one list of job duties. 
                    Then, consult with internal employees already
                    employed to give you more insights into specific 
                    skills and job requirements.

					Create questions that reflect skills in specific job duties
				</header>
            
				<p>
					Depending on the allotted time for each interview,
                    create a list of at least 10 questions or more that
                    you can ask each candidate. These questions should
                    help you identify a candidate's ability to perform 
                    specific job duties while using interpersonal or 
                    technical skills. Here are examples of interview
                    questions about job duties, grouped by skill:
					<br><br>
					<b style="color: rgb(136, 112, 4);">Questions to evaluate computer software proficiency:</b>
					<br> 1.What software programs do you have experience using?<br>
					2. How did you use software programs in previous job roles?
				</p>
                 <br>
				<b style="color: rgb(136, 112, 4);">Questions to evaluate teamwork capabilities:</b>
                <br> 1.Can you tell me about a time you went above and beyond to help a teammate?<br>
                2.Have you ever disagreed with a coworker on a project decision? How did you resolve it?
